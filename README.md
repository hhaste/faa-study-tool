# 💡 What's this?
A website I made to help me study for the FAA Private Pilot Knowledge Exam.

While using Sporty's practice tests, I found out you have to pay for their course in to study specifically the questions you got wrong. To get around that, I just ended up saving all my missed questions into a JSON file and created this app to quiz myself for free. I would've used Quizlet, but prefer something that's quick and interactive. This tool gives me a clean, efficient way to focus only on the areas I need to improve.

## ✈️ Features
- 🔁 Random question each time
- 📦 Progress saved in local storage
- 🧠 Interactive quiz-based style

## 🔮 Planned
This was a rushed 2-hour project so I could start using it ASAP. In the future, I'm hoping to make this a interactive quick study tool where you can create your own study sets. It'll be really easy to either import questions or type them up, and be able to study on the go.
